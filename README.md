This repository contains my work following the book "Ray Tracing in One Weekend"
written by Peter Shirley, Trevor David Black, and Steve Hollasch.

I followed along using the Rust language  instead of C++, and I use 32-bit floats
instead of 64-bit ones.

I bagan this project in January of 2025, along with members of a discord group
named "OpenGL Enthusiasts" where we would each implement the raytracer from the
book independently.

To run the project, clone the repo, and navigate to its directory. Then run the
command `cargo run --release > image.ppm`
